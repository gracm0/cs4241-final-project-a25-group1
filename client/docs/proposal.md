## PhotoBucket
### Amanda Longo, Grace Mahoney, Nia Junod
-------------------------------------------
We will be creating a web application called **Photobucket**. Photobucket is a bucket list app where you can collaborate with friends or on your own to complete the things youâ€™ve always wanted to do! Users will be able to log in or create an account and can create one or more bucket lists! You can add, delete, or edit the items within a list, similar to a normal to do list. When adding a new task, users can add a title, a small description, and an optional ideal deadline to complete the task and possibly a location too. To complete the bucket list item, users will have to upload a photo for evidence of completion and so that visual memories can be made along the way. These completed items will then be moved to a memories section of the web application where all of your photos will appear like a photo gallery, and you can click on each photo to see the stored details! 
We will build the **frontend** using React with Vite as the development and build tool, leveraging TypeScript for type safety and maintainability. We plan to use Tailwind CSS, in addition to downloading libraries from Aceternity UI components for a consistent interface. 
For the **backend**, we will use Node.js with Express to build a scalable server that can handle API requests efficiently. We will implent MongoDB for data storing, overall using the MERN Stack. Additionally, we plan to integrate the Google API to support authentication and future extensibility. The application will be hosted on Render to ensure reliable performance. 
We will be using Archivo & Roboto for our font, and we have inserted our color palette below
