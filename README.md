## General description
**PhotoBucket** is a collaborative bucket list web application that allows users to create, manage and share their life goals with their friends or family. Users can sign up and organize their goals within 4 custom bucket lists. Each bucket list contains individual items with descriptions, locations, priority levels and completion status, similar to a regular to do list. Our collaboration feature allows users to invite up to 4 people to their bucket list to work towards the same goals and create memories together. The collaboration aspect uses real time editing so that users can work at the same time to add and edit their goals.

What makes photobucket unique, is that our functionality centers around the visual completion system, where a user must upload or take a photo memory as evidence when marking a bucket list item as complete. These completed bucket list items are associated with those images and then moved to the **Bucket Gallery** so that you can revisit those bucket lists items you completed and have visual memories all in one place! The gallery is both a digital scrapbook, and a progress tracker which adds a more memorable experience. Built with TypeScript, React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, the application features secure authentication, responsive design with TailwindCSS, AceternityUI, cloud-based image storage through Cloudinary, and robust session management. Users can seamlessly navigate between different bucket lists, manage collaborators, customize bucket titles, and maintain persistent data across sessions, making PhotoBucket a comprehensive platform for turning dreams into documented realities.

## Technologies
----
### Frontend Technologies
- **React**: Core UI framework for building component-based user interfaces and managing state across bucket lists and collaboration features
- **TypeScript**: Provided type safety and enhanced development experience with strict typing for props, API responses, and data models
- **Vite**: Fast development server and build tool for optimized bundling and hot module replacement during development
- **React Router DOM**: Client-side routing for navigation between pages (Home, Bucket Lists, Join Bucket, Gallery)
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for responsive design and consistent styling across components

### Backend Technologies
- **Node.js & Express**: Server framework handling API routes, middleware, and HTTP request/response cycle
- **TypeScript**: Backend type safety for API endpoints, database models, and service functions
- **MongoDB & Mongoose**: NoSQL database for storing user accounts, bucket lists, items, and collaboration data with ODM for schema validation
- **Express Session**: Session management for user authentication and maintaining login state across requests
- **bcrypt**: Password hashing and authentication security for user account protection
- **CORS**: Cross-origin resource sharing configuration for frontend-backend communication

### Cloud & Storage Technologies
- **Cloudinary**: Cloud-based image storage and optimization for bucket list completion photos
- **Multer & multer-storage-cloudinary**: File upload middleware for handling image uploads from completion modal
- **MongoDB Atlas**: Cloud database hosting for production data persistence

### Authentication & Security
- **Express Sessions**: Server-side session management with MongoDB session store
- **bcrypt**: Secure password hashing using salt rounds for user authentication
- **CORS Configuration**: Secure cross-origin requests between frontend and backend
- **Environment Variables**: Secure configuration management for API keys and database credentials

### UI/UX Libraries & Components
- **AceternityUI Components**: Pre-built animated components for enhanced user experience (sidebar, buttons, modals)
- **React Icons**: Additional icon library for UI elements and actions
- **Custom Components**: Reusable components (BucketCard, Avatar, Modal components) built with TypeScript interfaces

## Contributions
Amanda: Came up with the idea for PhotoBucket and created the Figma mockup and Style Guide for the application before development. Implemented the fetching of storage for the images in the Bucket Gallery so they are store per user and not locally. Implemented the responsive and animated UI aspects (The animated sidebar, the button components), redeveloped the UI after initial implementation that Nia did, to match the aesthetic more to fit the Figma Mockup we had. 

Grace: Implemented the functionality of the collaboration aspect. Set up backend and database for storage of information. Initial log in 

Nia: Implemented the image uploader modal, made initial design for the pages and components. 

Together: A majority of what we worked on, all of us worked on it together in different pieces. With a majority of the things we implemented 

## Accessibility Features
<!--6. What accessibility features you included in your project.-->

Think of 1, 3, and 4 in particular in a similar vein to the design / technical achievements for A1â€”A4. Make a case for why what you did was challenging and why your implementation deserves a grade of 100%.
